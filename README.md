# Pelper
Pelper (Programmer helper) is a CodeIgniter helper that I use to expedite programming tasks.

## Functions

###dd() - Dump and die

It's a function that will output the variable on screen and exit the php file execution.

If it's an array or a method it will print_r() it. If it is something else it will var_dump() it.
